# iSCORE-PD_DAN_scRNASeq

iSCORE-PD: An isogenic stem cell collection to research Parkinsonâ€™s Disease

The following is a codebase covering the analaysis of scRNASeq data of human midbrain dopaminergic neurons differentiated in vitro from hESCs.

OVERVIEW:
1) Map raw reads + generate count matrices with 10x Genomics' CellRanger suite.
2) Initialize Seurat objects for each sample, perform QC filtering on each Seurat object.
3) Integrate the 3 subclones to generate an aggregate dataset of human midbrain DANs.
4) Evaluate cells against FOUNDIN-PD reference dataset.
